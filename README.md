# Udacity landing page project - the second project in the Front End Web Developer nanodegree program

## Project Summary

The project aims to give you the real-world scenarios of manipulating the DOM. The functionality serves two purposes: to prepare you for appending dynamically added data to the DOM, and to show you how javascript can improve the usability of an otherwise static site.

## The requirement of the project

- Build a multi-section landing page, with a dynamically updating navigational menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page.

- Clearly show the section being viewed while scrolling

- When clicking a navigation menu, the link should scroll to the apporpriate section.
